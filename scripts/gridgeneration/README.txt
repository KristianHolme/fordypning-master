Powershell scripts to automate the generation of structured and unstructured grid using the scripts provided in the official SPE11 CSP github repo: https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/tree/main/geometries

The scripts need a python environment with the gmsh package installed.

Basic usage:
- Navigate to this folder
- Have the CSP repo cloned into .\..\..\..\11thSPE-CSP
- Have a folder ./../../data/grid-files
	- This is the destination of the generated grid files.
	
- run one of the scripts
