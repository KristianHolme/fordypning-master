To run files (hopefully):

- have a copy of the repo spe11-utils in the main folder of this repo
 - used for extracting deck info
- grid files are stored in ./grid-files
    - file name examples:
        - spe11a_ref3_alg6.m (gmsh file in matlab format. generated from .geo file from 11thSPE-CSP)
            - corresponding gridcase name: "6tetRef3"
            - meshed using gmsh algorithm 6
            - generated with keyword refinement_Factor = 3
        - spe11a_struct280x120.m (gmsh file for structured grid. generated by scripts in 11thSPE-CSP)
            - corresponding gridcase name : "struct280x120"
        - spe11a_semi183x38_0.5_grid.mat (semi-structured grid generated from scripts in Vetle Nevlands master thesis https://github.com/vetlenev/Master-Thesis/tree/main/FluidFlower. resolution 183x38 and 0.5 density in unstructred regions)
        -  corresponding gridcase name: "semi183x154_0.5"

- ./scripts is added as an mrst module called prosjektOppgave
